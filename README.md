    - The logo and game title is the first thing the visitor sees. The colored shadow effects gives a hint to the visitor that the game is about colors.
- Game statistics and time section:
    - Below the game title you can see a devided section of the header that contains the following:
        - **Time:** shows "0" before the visitor starts a new game. After starting a new game a clock starts to count down from 20 seconds. When the clock reaches 0 the text changes to game over.
        - **Score:** shows the player how many scores that have been achived during the running game. A correct answer gives one point and an error will deduct one point. After the time is up it will still show the players score from the previous game until a new game is started.
        - **High score:** shows the highest score from previous games. This gives the player the oportunity to keep track of the best score achived so the player knows what score to try and beat.
- Instructions popup button:
    - The instructions popup button is located in a fixed position in the top left corner of the screen so the visitor easily can get additional    instructions on how to play the game. The button is in another color so the visitor clearly can see it.

### Validator Testing

- HTML
    - No errors were found when running the official w3c validator LINK.
- CSS
    - No errors were found when running the official (Jigsaw) validator. LINK
- JavaScript
    - No errors were found when running the official Jshint validator. LINK
        - The following metrics were returned:
            - There are XX functions in this file.
            - Function with the largest signature takes XX arguments, while the median is XX.
            - Largest function has 10 statements in it, while the median is XX.
            - The most complex function has a cyclomatic complexity value of 4 while the median is XX.

### Fixed Bugs
- Could not get the if statement in function "checkCorrectAnswer(type)" to work.
    - FIX: The arrays for words is in uppercase letters but the colors returned by the "document.getElementById("bottomWord").style.color;" returned lowercase letter. To get them to compare I first needed to make the words from array to lowercase letters before comparing them in the if statement.
- Could not get high score array to sort in the correct way.
    - FIX: I used the .sort() method to sort the array with the smallest number first. Then I took the last index of the array. I later found that sort() first converted the values to a string value and then tried to sort them. I found the solution on this site: [Solution to bug](https://dmitripavlutin.com/javascript-array-sort-numbers/)

- Could not keep the check and cross mark to be centered in the questions section when I changed screen size.
    - FIX: To get the check and cross mark to show in front of the questions section I had to make their position absolute. To keep them centered when changing screen size I needed to add transform: translate(-50% 50%), bottom: 50%, left 50% to their style properties.
### Unfixed Bugs
