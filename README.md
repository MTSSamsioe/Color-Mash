    - Below the game title you can see a devided section of the header that contains the following:
        - **Time:** shows "0" before the visitor starts a new game. After starting a new game a clock starts to count down from 20 seconds. When the clock reaches 0 the text changes to game over.

- JavaScript
    - No errors were found when running the official Jshint validator. LINK
        - The following metrics were returned:
            - There are XX functions in this file.
            - Function with the largest signature takes XX arguments, while the median is XX.
            - Largest function has 10 statements in it, while the median is XX.
            - The most complex function has a cyclomatic complexity value of 4 while the median is XX.

### Fixed Bugs
- Could not the if statement in function "checkCorrectAnswer(type)" to work.
    - FIX: The arrays for words is in Uppercase letters but the colors returned by the "document.getElementById("bottomWord").style.color;" returned lowercase letter. to get them to compare i neede to first make the words from array to lowercase letters before comparing in the if statement.
- Could not get high score array to sort in the correct way.
    - FIX: I used the .sort() method to sort the array with the smallest number first. Then I took the last index of the array. But I later found that .sort() first converted the values to a string value and then tryed to sort them. I found the solution on this site: [Solution to bug](https://dmitripavlutin.com/javascript-array-sort-numbers/)
